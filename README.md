# Portfolio

## Overview
This is the second official Portfolio Project I have completed as part of the CodeCademy Full Stack Pathway.
The aim was to build a personal portfolio site - a static website for sharing the projects built in this CodeCademy Path.
It was suggested that portfolio websites typically have a main page featuring different projects, and another page containing contact information.

#### Project Objectives
- Build a website using HTML & CSS.
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on my computer
- Deploy my site to the web using GitHub Pages

## Updates
As part of preparation for Northcoders, I spent some time reviewing the project and tried to refactor and improve the code base, while maintaining the site's responsiveness.
This resulted in changes including, but not limited to:
- Removing unnecessary classes and div's
- Rethinking previous layout decisions, in particular the use of CSS grid
- Accessibility improvements including updated ARIA tags and labels, and tweaks using the W3 markup validation service
- Multiple small aesthetic and functional tweaks
